**Evidence:**

The text states: ""Since DOC software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and distribute modified versions of this software.

This strongly suggests a permissive open-source license like the MIT License, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution with the requirement of including the original copyright notice.

**Explanation:**

While the text grants permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software, it does not explicitly name a specific open-source license like MIT, GPL, or Apache.  The terms provided are more akin to a permissive license, but without a formal designation, it's safest to assume it falls under ""UNLICENSED"" in the SPDX framework.
