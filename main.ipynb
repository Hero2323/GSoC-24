      "Version 1.2\n",
      "\n",
      "Préambule :\n",
      "\n",
      "Avec cette Licence Art Libre, l’autorisation est donnée de copier, de diffuser et de transformer librement les oeuvres dans le respect des droits de l’auteur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loin d’ignorer les droits de l’auteur, cette licence les reconnaît et les protège. Elle en reformule le principe en permettant au public de faire un usage créatif des oeuvres d’art.\n",
      "Alors que l’usage fait du droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique conduit à restreindre l’accès du public à l’oeuvre, la Licence Art Libre a pour but de le favoriser.\n",
      "L’intention est d’ouvrir l’accès et d’autoriser l’utilisation des ressources d’une oeuvre par le plus grand nombre. En avoir jouissance pour en multiplier les réjouissances, créer de nouvelles conditions de création pour amplifier les possibilités de création. Dans le respect des auteurs avec la reconnaissance et la défense de leur droit moral.\n",
      "\n",
      "En effet, avec la venue du numérique, l’invention de l’internet et des logiciels libres, un nouveau mode de création et de production est apparu. Il est aussi l’amplification de ce qui a été expérimenté par nombre d’artistes contemporains.\n",
      "Le savoir et la création sont des ressources qui doivent demeurer libres pour être encore véritablement du savoir et de la création. C’est à dire rester une recherche fondamentale qui ne soit pas directement liée à une application concrète. Créer c’est découvrir l’inconnu, c’est inventer le réel avant tout souci de réalisme.\n",
      "Ainsi, l’objet de l’art n’est pas confondu avec l’objet d’art fini et défini comme tel. C’est la raison essentielle de cette Licence Art Libre : promouvoir et protéger des pratiques artistiques libérées des seules règles de l’économie de marché.\n",
      "\n",
      "DÉFINITIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "– L’oeuvre :il s’agit d’une oeuvre commune qui comprend l’oeuvre originelle ainsi que toutes les contributions postérieures (les originaux conséquents et les copies). Elle est créée à l’initiative de l’auteur originel qui par cette licence définit les conditions selon lesquelles les contributions sont faites.\n",
      "\n",
      "– L’oeuvre originelle :c’est-à-dire l’oeuvre créée par l’initiateur de l’oeuvre commune dont les copies vont être modifiées par qui le souhaite.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Les oeuvres conséquentes :c’est-à-dire les propositions des auteurs qui contribuent à la formation de l’oeuvre en faisant usage des droits de reproduction, de diffusion et de modification que leur confère la licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Original (source ou ressource de l’oeuvre) :exemplaire daté de l’oeuvre, de sa définition, de sa partition ou de son programme que l’auteur présente comme référence pour toutes actualisations, interprétations, copies ou reproductions ultérieures.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Copie :toute reproduction d’un original au sens de cette licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Auteur de l’oeuvre originelle :c’est la personne qui a créé l’oeuvre à l’origine d’une arborescence de cette oeuvre modifiée. Par cette licence, l’auteur détermine les conditions dans lesquelles ce travail se fait.\n",
      "\n",
      "– Contributeur :toute personne qui contribue à la création de l’oeuvre. Il est l’auteur d’une oeuvre originale résultant de la modification d’une copie de l’oeuvre originelle ou de la modification d’une copie d’une oeuvre conséquente.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. OBJET\n",

      "\n",
      "2. L’ÉTENDUE DE LA JOUISSANCE\n",
      "Cette oeuvre est soumise au droit d’auteur, et l’auteur par cette licence vous indique quelles sont vos libertés pour la copier, la diffuser et la modifier:\n",
      "\n",

      "Vous pouvez diffuser librement les copies de ces oeuvres, modifiées ou non, quel que soit le support, quel que soit le lieu, à titre onéreux ou gratuit si vous respectez toutes les conditions suivantes:\n",
      "     – joindre aux copies, cette licence à l’identique, ou indiquer précisément où se trouve la licence,      – indiquer au destinataire le nom de l’auteur des originaux,      – indiquer au destinataire où il pourra avoir accès aux originaux (originels et/ou conséquents). L’auteur de l’original pourra, s’il le souhaite, vous autoriser à diffuser l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 LA LIBERTÉ DE MODIFIER\n",
      "Vous avez la liberté de modifier les copies des originaux (originels et conséquents), qui peuvent être partielles ou non, dans le respect des conditions prévues à l’article 2.2 en cas de diffusion (ou représentation) de la copie modifiée. L’auteur de l’original pourra, s’il le souhaite, vous autoriser à modifier l’original dans les mêmes conditions que les copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. L’INCORPORATION DE L’OEUVRE\n",
      "Tous les éléments de cette oeuvre doivent demeurer libres, c’est pourquoi il ne vous est pas permis d’intégrer les originaux (originels et conséquents) dans une autre oeuvre qui ne serait pas soumise à cette licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. VOS DROITS D’AUTEUR\n",
      "Cette licence n’a pas pour objet de nier vos droits d’auteur sur votre contribution. En choisissant de contribuer à l’évolution de cette oeuvre, vous acceptez seulement d’offrir aux autres les mêmes droits sur votre contribution que ceux qui vous ont été accordés par cette licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. LA DURÉE DE LA LICENCE\n",
      "Cette licence prend effet dès votre acceptation de ses dispositions. Le fait de copier, de diffuser, ou de modifier l’oeuvre constitue une acception tacite. Cette licence a pour durée la durée des droits d’auteur attachés à l’oeuvre. Si vous ne respectez pas les termes de cette licence, vous perdez automatiquement les droits qu’elle vous confère. Si le régime juridique auquel vous êtes soumis ne vous permet pas de respecter les termes de cette licence, vous ne pouvez pas vous prévaloir des libertés qu’elle confère.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. LES DIFFÉRENTES VERSIONS DE LA LICENCE\n",
      "Cette licence pourra être modifiée régulièrement, en vue de son amélioration, par ses auteurs (les acteurs du mouvement « copyleft attitude ») sous la forme de nouvelles versions numérotées.\n",
      "Vous avez toujours le choix entre vous contenter des dispositions contenues dans la version sous laquelle la copie vous a été communiquée ou alors, vous prévaloir des dispositions d’une des versions ultérieures.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. LES SOUS-LICENCES\n",
      "Les sous licences ne sont pas autorisées par la présente. Toute personne qui souhaite bénéficier des libertés qu’elle confère sera liée directement à l’auteur de l’oeuvre originelle.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. LA LOI APPLICABLE AU CONTRAT\n",
