AI-Powered Software License Identification

This project is designed to identify and extract relevant chunks of text that pertain to software licenses using large language models (LLMs). It is particularly useful for developers and legal teams who need to quickly identify licensing information in large bodies of text.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. The project uses Python 3.8+.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hero2323/GSoC-24.git
cd GSoC-24.git
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

You can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:

The project relies on the following libraries:

* loguru==0.7.2
* openai==1.31.1
* pandas==2.0.3
* tenacity==8.3.0
* ratelimit==2.2.1
* Nirjas==1.0.1
* fuzzywuzzy[speedup]>=0.18.0
* langchain_groq
* tiktoken

Ensure these are installed correctly before proceeding.

## Setting Up API Keys:

To run the LLM models, you need to set up your API keys for the relevant services. The project primarily uses the OpenAI API for its LLM capabilities.

### Step 1: Obtain an API Key

* Visit GroQ, TogetherAI, etc. and sign up for an account if you donâ€™t have one.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

You can add your API key to your environment variables to keep it secure:

For Linux/MacOS:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

For Windows:

```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key there:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Basic Usage

```
from helpers.llm_client import LLMClient
from helpers.models import *

client = LLMClient()

client._infer(model = Models.GEMMA_2_9b, prompt = 'Hey, How are you?', temperature = 0.1)
```
